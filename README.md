## Objective

The primary goal of the RecipeSharing-App is to simplify the process of finding recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. Whether you're looking to clear out your pantry or find a meal that matches your dietary needs, our app provides tailored suggestions to make cooking at home straightforward and enjoyable. Additionally, the app features a user-friendly interface that showcases different featured recipes on the main page, offering fresh culinary inspiration every time you visit.

## Skills Learned

Through this project, I have gained the following skills:

- **Connecting Angular applications to backend services**: Integrated Angular with a RESTful API, utilizing the `HttpClient` module for dynamic data fetching. This setup ensures communication between the frontend, handled by Angular, and the backend, developed with Next.js and Prisma, supported by a SQLite database. This integration facilitates real-time data exchange and state management.
- **Building front-end applications** with Angular and TypeScript: Developed interactive, user-friendly interfaces for the Recipe-sharing App, enhancing user experience.
- **Applying best practices** in Angular development: Utilized Angular's core functionalities like modules, services, and routing to structure the app effectively.
- **Styling components** using Bootstrap: Leveraged Bootstrap to design responsive and visually appealing components.
- **Managing application state** effectively using services and RxJS observables to handle data streams within the app.
- **Implementing database interactions** with Prisma and SQLite: Set up and managed a relational database to store and retrieve recipe data efficiently.

## How to Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
